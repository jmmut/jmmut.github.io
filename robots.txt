# The purpose of this "disallow everything" is to forbid entities from using my works for AI training.
# This is my "opt-out" right according to the DSM directive, article 4(3) in https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj/eng
# and applies to any entity that is registered or provides a service in the EU.
# Informally, if you're scraping this website for non-commercial and non-massive-AI purposes,
# I'm probably fine with that but this sentence is not a legally valid license for extracting my data,
# and I still reserve all my rights just in case.
