# Boids

Don't you love when simple behaviours using only local information lead to global patterns?

I remembered that boids (or any type of bird flocks, or fish schools) is in my to-do list of
simple and cool simulations, so I gave it a try. I loosely followed
[the rules from the wikipedia page for Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) and this is the
result:

frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
</div>

The source code is in [https://github.com/jmmut/boids](https://github.com/jmmut/boids), and you can try this in your computer at [https://jmmut.itch.io/boids](https://jmmut.itch.io/boids).
