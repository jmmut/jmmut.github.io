In summary, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)'>Go</a> is a board game that people have been studying for millenia. In that match, AlphaGo (an AI) did a move so advanced that not even the top players in the world expected. Lee Sedol won Match 5, and that's the last time a human could beat AlphaGo. AlphaGo winning Match 2 was an example of how a program used a new combination of moves that no human taught it explicitly, so programs can be creative.", answers: [

      "assess": {question: "The hard part of assigning more or less value to a thing is just having your goals correctly defined. If you find a random website that helps you with your work, you just measured the utility of the website for one of your goals. This is a mechanic evaluation and has been programmed many times by many people, just not with all human goals yet.", answers: [

Animals don't have the same goals as humans but we still say they are creative (like <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGPGknpq3e0'>crows</a>). The same goes for programs that have a set of goals and can estimate the value of a thing in terms of utility for any of those goals.", answers: [

      "undefined_goals": {question: "It's possible to program AIs without defining goals explicitly. For example, reinforcement learning just requires a sense of 'this is better' or 'this is worse'. As another example, when we want to classify things based on an intuitive sense of similarity, classification algorithms are usually able to generate the expected classification by exploiting the underlying mathematical properties of the data.", answers: [

      "no_conscience": {question: "I agree that we can't call computers conscious until we understand better what that means, but for the same reason I think it's unfair to say both 'computers are not conscious' and 'humans are conscious'. We have no way to disproof solipsism for now. And when we have a solid definition of consciousness and we can prove that humans are conscious, then we'll be able to engineer programs that meet the criteria.", answers: [
